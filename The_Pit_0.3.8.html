<p><strong>The Pit 0.3.8</strong> was the seventh major version of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced the <a href = "Corals">Corals</a> map, <a href = "Perks#Marathon">Marathon</a> perk, and some bug fixes and balance changes.</p>

<p>Upon release, the Marathon perk had the following description and stats. It was noted that the perk was "designed to give an edge while grinding in iron armor, and is particularly useful with <a href = "Perks#First_Strike">First Strike</a>, <a href = "Perks#Golden_Heads">Golden Heads</a>, or certain <a href = "Mystic_Well">mystic enchants</a>."</p>
