<p><strong>Bounties</strong> are statuses added to players randomly after they reach a <a href="Killstreaks">killstreak</a> of six or greater. Bounties consist of an amount of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> that is displayed above and around the player with floating numbers. On kill, a player has a chance to have a bounty placed on them, or if they already have one, for it to be increased (referred to as "bounty bumping"). Bounties increase by multiples of 50, up to <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">300g</span></a> at a time. When a bountied player is killed, their killer claims the value of the bounty. Players lose their bounties after being killed.</p>

<p>The higher a player's killstreak, the higher their initial bounty will be, and the higher their bounty bumps will be. Additionally, players will receive bounty bumps more frequently if they kill players in quick succession.</p>
  <p>The maximum bounty a player can normally have is <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5,000g</span></a>. This can be increased by to <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">10,000g</span></a> with the <a href = "Highlander">Highlander</a> megastreak. Every <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,000g</span></a> in the player's bounty extends their combat timer by 5 seconds, up to an additional 25 seconds (<a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5,000g</span></a>) or up to 50 seconds (<a href="Gold"><span class="m6">10,000g</span></a>) with the Highlander megastreak. It's unknown if higher bounties can further extend the combat timer.</p>

  <p>The amount of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> claimed from a bounty can be increased by 50% using a <a href = "Item_Shop#Bounty_Solvent">Bounty Solvent</a>. Additionally, players using the <a href = "Perks#Bounty_Hunter">Bounty Hunter</a> perk earn assist shares of bounties.</p>
  <p>With the <a href = "Genesis">Genesis</a> tier V <a href = "Factions">faction</a> perk, your bounty bumps are increased by 50%.</p><hr class="smallbreak">

  <p>The <a href = "Dark_Pants#Golden_Handcuffs">Golden Handcuffs</a> dark mystic, after claiming a bounty, grants a fraction of the gold to all players on the server. The claimer keeps the original value of the bounty.</p>
  <p>The <a href = "Everyone_Gets_a_Bounty">Everyone Gets a Bounty</a> event allows players to bypass the maximum bounty limit.</p>
  <p>Players can claim their own <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5,000g</span></a> bounties with <a href="Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a> enchanted with <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Selfcheckout">Self-checkout</a>.</p>
