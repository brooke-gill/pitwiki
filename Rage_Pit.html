<p><strong>Rage Pit</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Rage Pit lasts for 4 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Rage Pit starts, glass walls appear restricting access to all areas except the center. Players' placement during the event is determined by how much damage they dealt to other players during the event.</p>
<p>During Rage Pit, the following gameplay changes take effect:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>All players have double health.</li>
    <li>Double <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> on kills and assists.</li>
    <li>Healing items are replaced with Rage Potatoes (<span class="mc">1♥&#xFE0E;</span> of health, <span class="me">2♥&#xFE0E;</span> absorption, Resistance II (0:08), Speed I (0:08)). Healing item limits remain the same.</li>
    <li>The <a href = "Perks#Vampire">Vampire</a> perk is disabled. Earning <a href = "Perks#Soup">Soup</a> on assist is disabled.</li>
    <li>Players are unable to place blocks during the event.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The following rewards can be obtained based on players' placements during Rage Pit:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">2 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">2,000 gold</span></a> and if the player scored within the top 3</li>   
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">1 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">500 gold</span></a> if the player scored within the top 20</li>
  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">100 gold</span></a> if the player did not score within the top 20</li></ul>

<p>Additional rewards that players can earn during Rage Pit:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">500 gold</span></a> if 600 total players were killed during the event</li>

<p class="section">Trivia</p>
<p>Prior to a patch in early 2021, the <a href="Mystic_Bow#Devil_Chicks">Devil Chicks</a> mystic could be used to deal an absurd amount of damage during the Rage Pit event.</p>
<p>The <a href = "Rage_Pants">Deal with the Devil III</a> enchant, prior to its removal, would increase damage dealt in Rage Pit by 10% while worn.</p>
