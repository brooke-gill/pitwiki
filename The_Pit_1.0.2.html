<p><strong>The Pit 1.0.2</strong> was a minor version of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced the <a href = "Renown#Pure_Rage">Pure Rage</a> renown upgrade and <a href = "Rage_Pants">Rage Pants</a>, along with some balance changes.</p>

It allowed users to craft <a href = "Rage_Pants">Rage Pants</a> for 17 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunk of Vile</a>. When enchanted in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a> to tier I, Rage Pants gain 1-2 tokens of a random Rage enchantment, after which they can be upgraded to further tiers, following the same enchanting process as normal <a href = "Mystic_Pants">mystic pants</a>. A pair of Rage Pants is required for the sacrifice when upgrading to tier III. Rage enchantments are typically designed to counter some aspect of a typical player's items or perk loadout.</p>

</ul>
<p><i>Note: </i><span class = md>RARE!</span> Deal with the Devil<i> was removed from the pool of possible enchantments almost immediately.</i></p>
