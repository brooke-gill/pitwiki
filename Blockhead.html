<p><strong>Blockhead</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, before it occurs, 3 minutes of advance warning is given. Blockhead lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Blockhead starts, players are randomly assigned a unique block. Killing players splatters the block around the area they died. If players gained assists for a kill, their blocks will be contained within the splatter based on their assist percentage. Players' placement during the event is determined by how many of their blocks are on the map at the end of the event.</p>
<p>During Blockhead, the following gameplay changes take effect:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li><span class="me">Quicktrail</span> powerups spawn around the map in preset locations. Picking them up grants Quicktrail (0:20). While under the Quicktrail effect, gain Speed I and your blocks will appear wherever you walk. Quicktrail powerups regenerate after 15 seconds.</li>
    <li><span class="mc">Combat Boost</span> powerups spawn around the map in preset locations. Picking them up grants Combat Boost (0:30). While under the Combat Boost effect, the splatter of blocks from kills has an increased radius and you take <span class="m9">−20%</span> damage. Combat Boost powerups regenerate after 15 seconds.</li>
    <li><span class="ma">Super Heal</span> powerups spawn around the map in preset locations. Picking them up heals you to full and grants <span class="me">4♥&#xFE0E;</span> absorption (max <span class="me">8♥&#xFE0E;</span>). Super Heal powerups regenerate after 15 seconds.</li>
  <li><span class="mb">Diamond Armor</span> powerups spawn around the map in preset locations. Picking them up grants players a diamond helmet, chestplate and boots. Diamond armor earned from the event is removed at the end of the event. Diamond Armor powerups regenerate after 15 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following rewards can be obtained based on players' placements during Blockhead:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">2 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">4,000 gold</span></a> and if the player scored within the top 5</li>   
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">1 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,500 gold</span></a> if the player scored within the top 15</li>
  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">75 gold</span></a> if the player did not score within the top 15</li></ul>

<p>Additional rewards that players can earn during Blockhead:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,250 gold</span></a> if at least 10,000 blocks were replaced during the event</li>
  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">666 gold</span></a> and <a href="XP"><span class="mb">666 XP</span></a> for killing 10 players during the event</li>
</ul><hr class="smallbreak">
<p class="section">Trivia</p>
<p>Prior to a patch in early 2021, the Note Block could not be overridden. The note block was eventually removed from the possible blocks.</p>
<p>The Blockhead event is loosely based on the video game Splatoon.</p>
