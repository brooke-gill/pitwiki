<hr>

<span><strong>Uberstreak</strong> is a <a href = "Megastreaks">megastreak</a> in the Hypixel Pit. It is the seventh megastreak unlocked chronologically and the sixth purchasable megastreak. It can be purchased in the <a href = "Renown">Renown Shop</a> for <a href = "Renown"><span class = me>50 renown</span></a> at Prestige <span class = m5>XX</span> and can be activated in the shop for <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>50,000g</span></a>. It activates upon the player reaching 100 kills.<br>

<span>While the megastreak is active, the Uberstreak megastreak has one perk:</span>




<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

<li>Gain <span class="md">+50%</span> chance to find mystic items from kills.</li>

</ul>




<span>As players earn kills during an Uberstreak, their ability to get kills and stay alive becomes progressively worse. </span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  <li>Every 100 kills, the player takes <span class = mc>+10%</span> damage from all sources.</li>

  <li>At 100 kills, activate Uberstreak. Deal <span class="m5">−40%</span> damage to players with no <a href="Prestige">prestige</a>.</li>

  <li>At 200 kills, lose <span class="mc">2♥&#xFE0E;</span> max health.</li>

  <li>At 300 kills, potion effects last half as long as they normally do.</li>

  <li>At 400 kills, lose the ability to heal.</li>

</ul>




<span>After the player dies, if they had at least 400 kills, they will receive an Uberdrop.</span><br><br>

  <span>Uberdrops can contain: </span><br>

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

    <li>5–20 <a href = "Philosophers_Cactus">Philosopher's Cactus</a></li>

    <li>1–3 <a href = "Funky_Feather">Funky Feathers</a></li>

  <li>1 <a href="Mystic_Sword">Mystic Sword</a> with the <a href="Mystic_Sword#Hidden_Jewel">Hidden Jewel</a> enchant</li>

  <li>1 <a href="Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a></li>
   
  <li>A permanent +1% higher chance to find <a href = "Mystic_Well">standard mystic items</a> from kills. Mystic drop chance can be claimed up to 10 times (+10% higher chance).</li>

</ul>

  <span>Unlike most megastreaks, there is a limit to rewards earned from Uberstreak. Players may only earn an Uberdrop four times in a 24-hour period. While the first daily Uberdrop is free, the second, third, and fourth ones cost <a href="Renown"><span class="me">5</span></a>, <a href="Renown"><span class="me">10</span></a>, and <a href="Renown"><span class="me">15 renown</span></a> respectively. After the fourth daily Uberdrop, players will no longer receive Uberdrops until the next day. The limit resets 24 hours after the first Uberstreak is completed.</span><br><br>


  <span>Unlike other megastreaks, no other <a href="Killstreaks">killstreaks</a> are bundled with Uberstreak.</span><br>
<br>

<span>While Uberdrops are extremely difficult to obtain, their high value causes many players to attempt Uberstreaks.</span>
