<span class="subheader">From the <a href="./">Hypixel Pit Wiki</a></span>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Pit 0.4</strong> was the eighth major version of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced several new events, event leaderboards, trading, the <a href = "Renown#Cool_Conclave">Cool Conclave</a> renown upgrade, some balance changes, and some bug fixes.</p>

<p>Events added with the update include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "Squads">Squads</a></li>
  <li><a href = "Spire">Spire</a> (Required floor <b><span class = m5>SEVEN</span></b> to receive floor bonus at the time.)</li>
  <li><a href = "Blockhead">Blockhead</a></li>
  <li><a href = "Giant_Cake">Giant Cake</a></li>
  <li><a href = "King_of_the_Ladder">King of the Ladder</a></li>
  <li><a href = "Auction">Auction</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The active event would also be displayed in the bossbar with a timer displaying when the event would start and when the event would end.</p>

<p>A leaderboard was added to the spawn area, allowing players to view the leaderboard for certain event stats, resetting every three months. The leaderboards only displayed players who had joined the Pit in the last 7 days. The selected leaderboard could be changed using the <a href = "NPCs#Leaderboard_Picker">Leaderboard Picker</a> rabbit NPC.</p>

<p>Players who helped contribute to the development of these events through the forums may use the /credit command to be credited in-game when these events occur. These players were also given <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">200,000 gold</span></a> for their contribution. A full list of these players may be found <a href = "https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5cb83bcdf2a70.event_contest_winners.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Commands#trade">/trade [<span class = m7>username</span>]</a> command was also added to the game, allowing players to trade items and gold with each other. A shortcut command, <a href = "Commands#offer">/offer [<span class = m7>username</span>] [<span class = m7>price (in gold)</span>]</a>, was also added, giving the target player 30 seconds to decide whether to trade the user's held item for the gold price listed. Both commands were subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Players could only complete 8 trades per day.</li>
  <li>Players could trade a maximum of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">30,000 gold</span></a> per day. Trades that would bypass either player's gold limit would not be completed.</li>
  <li>Players below level <span class = m7>[<span class = m6><b>60</b></span>]</span> could not trade regardless of prestige.</li>
  <li>Nicknamed players could not initiate trades or offers.</li>
  <li>Trades could not be initiated with players who had ignored the user.</li>
  <li>Players in combat could not trade.</li>
  <li>Players could only send trade requests every 60 seconds. The timer reset on successful trades.</li>
  <li>Only one active trade request could be sent by a player at once.</li>
  <li>Players could only send two concurrent offer requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href = "Commands#tradelimits">/tradelimits</a> command was also added, allowing players to view how many trades they had completed and how much gold they could still trade that day.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Renown#Cool_Conclave">Cool Conclave</a> renown upgrade was added, allowing players to use the <a href = "Commands#cool">/cool</a> command. When used, the player is provided with a list of all players in their current lobby who have Prestige <span class = m9>IV</span> or higher, in order of highest to lowest prestige. It could be purchased at Prestige <span class = m6>X</span> for <a href = "Renown"><span class = me>10 renown</span></a>.</p>

<p>Balance changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(<span class = "ma">↑</span>) The <a href = "Raffle">Raffle</a> event now requires (35 → 27) tickets deposited to earn the participation bonus.</li>
  <li>(<span class = "mc">↓</span>) The <a href = "Perks#Vampire">Vampire</a> perk is now disabled in <a href = "Rage_Pit">Rage Pit</a>.</li>
  <li>(<span class = "mc">↓</span>) The <a href = "Mystic_Bow#Telebow">Telebow</a> enchantment is now disabled for the <a href = "Beast">Beast</a>.</li>
  
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href = "Perks#First_Strike">First Strike</a> perk's speed no longer overrides all other sources of speed, regardless of duration or potency.</li>
  <li>The <a href = "Mystic_Pants#TNT">TNT</a> enchantment's TNT no longer breaks <a href = "Care_Package">Care Packages</a>. (Note: it was claimed in the prior <a href = "The_Pit_0.3.9">Tiny Bugpatch</a> that this had already been fixed.)</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with the <a href = "Commands#dropconfirm">/dropconfirm</a> command causing items to disappear.</li>
  <li>Added messages when attempting to drop items that can't be dropped.</li>
  <li>Homing projectiles no longer target players in spawn.</li>
  <li>Players using the <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Singularity">Singularity</a> enchantment no longer take no knockback.</li>
</ul>
