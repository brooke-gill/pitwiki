<p>The <strong>Mini Cake</strong> is an item used to complete the <a href="Kings_Quest">King's Quest</a> on the Castle map.</p>
<p>To bake the Mini Cake, the following five items are needed:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Forty&nbsp;<a href="Castle#Packaged_Bale">Packaged Bales</a>, obtained by right-clicking a crafting table with a stack of wheat;</li>
<ul>
  <li>The crafting tables are located in a water mill at (103, 76, 9).</li><br>
</ul>
<li>Six&nbsp;<a href="Castle#HighGrade_Egg">High-Grade Eggs</a>, obtained by feeding <a href="Castle#Yummy_Bread">Yummy Bread</a> to chickens;</li>
<ul>
  <li>To obtain Yummy Bread, a player needs to right click any furnace in the Kings map with 64 wheat. These furnaces can be found in the barn located at (55, 77, −85).</li>
  <li>The player will then need to go to the Forest quadrant of the map. Upon reaching the shooting range located at (-94, 80, −31), the player will need to stand on the red clay line and shoot any target in front of them. This will cause a chicken to fly out; feeding one Yummy Bread to it will cause it to lay an egg.</li><br>

</ul>
<li>Twelve&nbsp;<a href="Castle#Sugar_Extract">Sugar Extract</a>, obtained by mining melon blocks with an axe;</li>
<ul>The axe is obtained from the <a href = "Perks#Barbarian">Barbarian</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade. It costs 10 <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> and requires <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="m9">II</span>. The melons are located on the ship in the Port quadrant; they can be found at (-16, 67, 100).</ul><br>
<li>Two&nbsp;<a href="Castle#Milk_Bucket">Milk Buckets</a>, found in chests in the <a href="Sewers">sewers</a>;</li>
<ul>The sewers can be found beneath the City quadrant. In the sewers, chests frequently spawn, infrequently containing milk.</ul><br>
<li>One&nbsp;<a href="Castle#Cherry">Cherry</a>, a rare drop from killing players.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the player is unable to complete one or more of these items themselves, they may trade with other players to obtain them.</p>
<p>After all of these items are collected, the player will need to talk to the Baker, an NPC that spawns in a random position of the map. Upon giving the baker these ingredients, they will be given one Mini Cake.</p><hr class="smallbreak">
