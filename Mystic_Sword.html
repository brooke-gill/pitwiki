<p><strong>Mystic Swords</strong> are mystic items obtained extremely rarely from killing players while the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade.</p>
<p>While unenchanted, Mystic Swords act as golden swords enchanted with Sharpness II. However, they can be upgraded in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a>. Upgrading to tier I costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1,000g</span></a>, upgrading to tier II costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">4,000g</span></a>, and upgrading to tier III costs <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">8,000g</span></a>, requires Mysticism IV, and requires a sacrifice of a randomly chosen color of <a href = "Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a>.</p>
<p>Enchanting Mystic Swords gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 2 if their user logs out while in combat without attacking someone immediately before leaving. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" it, destroying it forever.</p>
<p>When enchanted, Mystic Swords gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1–2 "<a href="Mystic_Well#Tokens">tokens</a>" – total tiers – of a low-grade enchantment. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1–2 more tokens  of any enchantment (at most one of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>), and at tier III, they gain 1–4 more tokens (at most three of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>) – up to 8 total.</p>
<p>Mystic Swords may not have more than 3 unique enchants or more than 8 tokens of enchantment, even through usage of the <a href = "Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a>.</p>
<p>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I is as follows:</p>
