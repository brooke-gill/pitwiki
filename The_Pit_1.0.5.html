<hr>
<p><strong>The Pit 1.0.5</strong> was a patch for the Hypixel Pit. It introduced the Insurance perk, balance changes, bug fixes, and other minor changes.</p>

<p>The Endless Quiver perk's name was changed to Insurance. Its arrow-return mechanic was moved to the <a href = "Perks#Spammer">Spammer</a> perk. The Insurance perk would supposedly return full health to the player and grant Resistance II (0:04) if they died within 2 seconds of first being attacked. However, the perk did not work as intended, sometimes reviving the player far earlier than intended, and sometimes reviving the player on death despite it being far longer than 2 seconds since they were first attacked.</p>

<p>A new <a href = "Rage_Pants">Rage Pants</a> enchantment, <a href = "Rage_Pants#Ace_of_Spades">Ace of Spades</a>, was added. It reduces damage taken from players using <a href = "Item_Shop#Combat_Spade">Combat Spades</a>.</p>

<p>Some major features were reworked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href = "Renown#Promotion">Promotion!!</a> renown upgrade no longer saves mystics' lives above a 50 kill streak. It now gives <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>+2g</span></a> and <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>+15%</span></a> XP on kills and assists, and adds 1 to to user's killstreak on every fourth kill while the <a href = "Perks#Assistant_to_the_Streaker">Assistant to the Streaker</a> perk is equipped.</li>
  <li>The Withercraft killstreak has been renamed to <a href = "Killstreaks#Rush">Rush</a> and reworked, now activating every 5 kills and giving the user +1.5% speed every activation, up to +15%.</li>
  <li>The Grand Finale megastreak has been renamed to <a href = "Magnum_Opus">Magnum Opus</a>, requires 50 kills (down from 100), and now also consumes up to 4 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a> to repair up to 4 lives on the item in the Mystic Well. (It was intended to consume double the vile for items that have had a <a href = "Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a> applied, but this feature did not work.)</li>
</ul>    

<p>Balance changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Perks#Spammer">Spammer</a>'s gold boost has been increased from <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>+100%</span></a> to <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>+200%</span></a>.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) Golden Pickaxes have been removed from the <a href = "Renown">Renown Shop</a>. They are now available in the <a href = "Item_Shop#Golden_Pickaxe">Item Shop</a> for <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>500g</span></a>. New Golden Pickaxes have unlimited durability and instantly break 5-block pillars of obsidian after clicking twice on them. Players who unlocked the old Golden Pickaxe could have <span class = me>10</span> <a href = "Renown"><span class = me>renown</span></a> refunded.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Bow#Telebow">Telebow</a>'s cooldown is reset if the user attempted to teleport out of bounds.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Diamond_Allergy">Diamond Allergy</a> now protects from <a href = "Item_Shop#Combat_Spade">Combat Spades</a>.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Bow#Chipping">Chipping</a> now deals (half → double) the damage it is intended to. This was changed at an unknown later date to the intended value.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Bow#What_doesnt_kill_you">What doesn't kill you</a>'s cooldown is now correctly set to 3 seconds.</li>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Peroxide">Peroxide</a> now instantly heals the player when hit instead of granting Regeneration.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Peroxide I: When hit, gain (Regeneration I (0:05) → <span class = mc>0.5♥</span>, 1s cooldown).</li>
    <li>Peroxide II: When hit, gain (Regeneration I (0:08) → <span class = mc>0.7♥</span>, 1s cooldown).</li>
    <li>Peroxide III: When hit, gain (Regeneration II (0:08) → <span class = mc>1.0♥</span>, 1s cooldown).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) New instances of the following special items now have increased lives:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href = "Golden_Helmet">Golden Helmet</a>: (5 → 50) lives.</li>
    <li><a href = "Archangel_Chestplate">Archangel Chestplate</a>: (12 → 100) lives.</li>
    <li><a href = "Armageddon_Boots">Armageddon Boots</a>: (3 → 66) lives.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) Iron and Diamond boots on the ground no longer override <a href = "Armageddon_Boots">Armageddon Boots</a> when picked up.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Item_Shop#FirstAid_Egg">First-Aid Egg</a> cooldown (10 → 30 seconds), now reduces cooldown by 5 seconds on kill and removes the Speed effect from the user on use.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Item_Shop#Iron_Pack">Iron Pack</a> no longer has a helmet.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Divine_Miracle">Divine Miracle</a> now has reduced activation chances:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Divine Miracle I: (15% → 10%) chance to save mystics' lives on death.</li>
    <li>Divine Miracle II: (30% → 20%) chance to save mystics' lives on death.</li>
    <li>Divine Miracle III: (45% → 30%) chance to save mystics' lives on death.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) Self-damage from <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Gamble">Gamble</a> cannot be mitigated anymore. Damage inflicted by the enchantment to others may still be avoided.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) Unknown changes to <a href = "Mystic_Pants#RetroGravity_Microcosm">Retro-Gravity Microcosm</a> cause the enchantment to no longer have any effect.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Rage_Pants#Regularity">Regularity</a> now includes true damage inflicted in the calculation to determine if it activates, and the second strike no longer adds to Combo enchantments.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Respawn_Resistance">Respawn Resistance</a> now clears Resistance from the user if the pants are removed.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) Players may only receive rewards from <a href = "Uberstreak">Uberstreaks</a> four times daily, costing 0, <span class = me>5</span>, <span class = me>10</span>, and <span class = me>15 renown</span> for each respective completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "Perks#Coop_Cat">Co-op Cat</a>'s position in the Renown Shop was changed to be in the same location as the <a href = "Prestige">Prestige</a> <span class = m9>I</span> upgrades, but the requirement was not changed, despite the patch notes stating that it was.</li>
  <li><a href = "Mystic_Sword#The_Punch">The Punch</a> now applies 20s of immunity to streak resets from entering spawn.</li>
  <li>Players at <a href = "Prestige">Prestige</a> <span class = m9>I</span> or higher may now toggle off receiving starting items when respawning (Iron Swords, Bows, <a href = "Renown#Autobuy">Autobought</a> Diamond Swords)</li>
  <li><a href = "Mystic_Sword#Billionaire">Billionaire</a> now accurately states that it provides an additive percent increase to damage in the description instead of misleadingly stating that it multiplies damage.</li>
  <li>The maximum <a href = "Prestige">Prestige</a> has been increased to 50 (L).</li>
  <li>All prestige gold requirements have been reduced, and higher prestiges have a maximum requirement of <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>2,000,000 gold</span></a>.
  <li>Dying three times without getting a kill now grants a golden apple or equivalent healing item based on your active <a href = "Perks">perks</a>.</li>
  <li>Items in the <a href = "Stash">Stash</a> now lose lives on death.</li>
  <li>The <a href = "Commands#offer">/offer</a> command now fails if the user adds more arguments than name and gold value, in order to prevent scams.</li>
  <li>Note blocks no longer appear as a block in the <a href = "Blockhead">Blockhead</a> event.</li>
  <li>Small cooldown added to all killstreak items in order to prevent accidentally consuming multiple at once.</li>
  <li>When a player is nicked, their <a href = "Pit_Supporter">Pit Supporter</a> star is automatically hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some exploits were also fixed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic items</a> may not leave your inventory while on a <a href = "Megastreak">megastreak</a> or while the <a href = "Magnum_Opus">Magnum Opus</a> megastreak is equipped. Logging out while on a megastreak will now also cause the player to lose lives in additino to causing a death.</li>
  <li>Leaving the game immediately after attacking someone now properly causes the user to lose lives on mystic items.</li>
  <li>The <a href = "Killstreaks#Gold_Nanofactory">Gold Nano-factory</a> killstreak's ingots do not turn into tickets when a <a href = "Raffle">Raffle</a> event starts.</li>
  <li><a href = "Mystic_Pants">Martyrdom</a> can no longer activate above the pregame lobby (allowing creepers to push players out of spawn).</li>
