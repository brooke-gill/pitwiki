<span><strong>Fresh Pants</strong>, commonly referred to as "fresh", are mystic items obtained from various sources. This page is about the standard colors of Fresh Pants. Links to the pages for special types of Fresh Pants can be found below.</span>
<br>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  
<li>Fresh <a href="Aqua_Pants">aqua pants</a>, used for fishing;</li>
<li>Fresh <a href="Dark_Pants">dark pants</a>, used to negate the effects of other mystic pants. Note that while other fresh pants are as strong as iron, dark pants are only as strong as leather.</li>
<li>Fresh <a href="Rage_Pants">rage pants</a>, designed to be powerful against certain enchantments and items;</li>
<li>Fresh <a href="Sewer_Pants">sewer pants</a>, pants with the ability to turn into powerful mystic pants.</li>
</ul>
  <span>Standard colors of fresh pants (<span class = mc>Red</span>, <span class = m6>Orange</span>, <span class = me>Yellow</span>, <span class = ma>Green</span>, and <span class = m9>Blue</span>), have a very low chance to be dropped on kill if the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> renown perk. Other pants are obtained in various ways, which are described in their corresponding pages.</span>
  <br>
  <span>While unenchanted, standard fresh pants act as iron pants However, they can be upgraded in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well.</a> Upgrading standard pants to tier I costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>1,000g</span></a>, upgrading them to tier II costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>4,000g</span></a>, and upgrading them to tier III costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>8,000g</span></a> and a sacrifice of the same color of pants.</span><br><br> 
  <br>
  <span>Enchanting Fresh Pants gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 3 if you log out while in combat. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" it, destroying it forever.</span>
  <span>When enchanted, standard Fresh Pants gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1–2 "tokens" – total tiers – of a low-grade enchantment. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1–2 more tokens of any enchantment, and at tier III, they gain 1–4 more tokens – up to 8 total.</span>
  <br><br>
  <span>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I is as follows:</span><br><br>

<span>To save inventory space, ten pairs of fresh pants of any color can be merged into one inventory slot using an empty Pants Bundle (typically abbreviated as "pb" when full).<br>Empty Pants Bundles are a shop item that can be unlocked in the Renown shop at prestige <span class="m6">XII</span> for <a href="Renown"><span class="me">20 renown</span></a>. Once unlocked, they can be purchased at the "Items" NPC for 50 <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a>.</span><br>
