<hr>
<p><strong>Dark Pants</strong> are special types of <a href="Mystic_Pants">Mystic Pants</a> designed to counter <a href="Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a>. Fresh Dark Pants can be crafted for 5 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a> and <a href="Renown"><span class="me">2 renown</span></a> <strong>at night</strong> if the user has at least one tier of the <a href="Prestige">prestige <span class="me">VI</span></a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade Heresy. Every extra tier of Heresy the player has reduces the vile cost of Dark Pants by 1 Chunk of Vile, with a minimum of 3 chunks at Heresy III. Dark Pants are as strong as leather pants.</p>
<p>Dark Pants function differently from Fresh Pants. Upgrading Dark Pants to tier I requires <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">10,000g</span></a> and <a href="Renown#Heresy">Heresy</a> I, but unlike typical Mystic Pants, it requires Mysticism I instead of Mysticism IX. Tier I Dark Pants will always be enchanted with Somber and have 5–20 lives. </p>

<p>Dark Pants' enchantments only have an effect if the user has at least one tier of <a href = "Renown#Heresy">Heresy</a>.</p>

  <ul>
<li>Dark Pants used to be as strong as chainmail pants. This was changed to leather in early 2020.</li>
<li>The time period the Nostalgia enchantment refers to is the time before the <a href="The_Pit_0.3.5">0.3.5</a> update, when Protection I diamond armor could be found in <a href="Care_Package">Care Packages</a>.</li></span></div>
