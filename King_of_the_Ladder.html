<hr>
<span><strong>King of the Ladder</strong>, or KOTL, is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> occuring in the Pit. The event lasts for 3 minutes.<br>When the event is active, a structure out of green hardened clay spawns in a random quadrant of the map. Standing on the structure rewards <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> every second, with a higher rate of <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> being rewarded at higher-up platforms. When more than one player is on a platform of the structure, the <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> is distributed evenly between every player that is standing on it, incentivizing players to hit each other off. KOTL gives 2× <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> and <a href="XP"><span class="mb">XP</span></a> for kills and assists near the event zone.<br><br>
