<p><strong>Beast</strong> is a <a href="Major_Event">major event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Beast lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Beast event starts, three random players are chosen to be beasts. If a player kills the beast, they become a beast. Beasts are given a diamond chestplate with Protection II, diamond leggings with Fire Protection V (if they are not wearing Mystic Pants), diamond boots with Projectile Protection V, and a diamond sword. Placement is determined by how many beasts a player killed and how many players they killed as the beast.</p>
<p>During Beast, the following gameplay changes take effect:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Beasts gain <span class = mc>10♥&#xFE0E;</span> but cannot gain health by any method.</li>
    <li>Beasts get permanent Slowness I. If they are too far away from the center, they will take <span class="td">1♥&#xFE0E;</span> of true damage every second until dead, at which point a random player becomes a beast.</li>
    <li>Double <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> and <a href="XP"><span class="mb">XP</span></a> on kills and assists while you are a beast.</li>
    <li>Beasts gain <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">250g</span></a> for every 5 total seconds that they have been a beast.</li>
    <li>Beasts do not lose lives on mystic items on death.</li>
    <li>All mystics that provide healing are disabled.</li>
    <li>Players are unable to place blocks during the event.</li>
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be obtained based on players' placements during Beast:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">2 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">2,000 gold</span></a> if the player placed within the top 3</li>
  <li><a href="Renown"><span class="me">1 renown</span></a> and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">500 gold</span></a> if the player placed within the top 20</li>   
  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">100 gold</span></a> if the player did not place within the top 20</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional rewards that players can earn during Beast:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

  <li><a href="Gold"><span class="m6">500 gold</span></a> if no beast was the beast for longer than a total of 90 seconds</li>
  <li>Diamond chestplate and boots if the player was a Beast at the end of the event</li>

</ul><br>
