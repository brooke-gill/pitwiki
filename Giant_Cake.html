<span><strong>Giant Cake</strong> is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> occuring in The Pit. The event lasts for 2 minutes.<br>When the event occurs, a giant cake, created by hundreds of smaller cakes in a cuboid shape, spawns in a random area of the map. Players are able to eat slices of the cake by right- or left-clicking them. Players will receive <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">gold</span></a> for eating slices of cake; their rewards increase the more cake they consume. Most cake slices award <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1 gold</span></a>. This increases by <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">0.25 gold</span></a> for every 50 cake slices eaten. Eating the last slice of a cake awards <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">5 gold</span></a>, increasing by <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">1.25 gold</span></a> for every 50 slices eaten.</span><br>
<span>Two additional types of cake exist in the giant cake:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li><span><strong>Cherries</strong> (red stained clay), which award <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">150 gold</span></a>, increasing by <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">37.5g</span></a> for every 50 slices eaten;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> (black stained clay), which award <a href="XP"><span class="mb">100 XP</span></a>. The <a href="XP"><span class="mb">XP</span></a> earned from chocolate chips is unaffected by XP Boost.</span></li>
</ul>

<span>Eating a whole cake inside the giant cake has a chance for it to drop tasty <strong>Milk</strong>, granting <span class="me">2â™¥&#xFE0E;</span> of Absorption (with no cap), and <strong>Cookies</strong>, granting Speed II (0:25).</span><br><br>
