<p><strong>Mystic Pants</strong> are wearable and enchantable pairs of pants. Players can obtain Mystic Pants from enchanting Fresh Pants, <a href="Auction">auctions</a>, and trading.</p>
  <p><span class="anchor" id="Fresh_Pants"></span>Fresh Pants are unenchanted versions of Mystic Pants. Standard colors of Fresh Pants (<span class = mc>red</span>, <span class = m6>orange</span>, <span class = me>yellow</span>, <span class = ma>green</span>, and <span class = m9>blue</span>), have a very low chance to be dropped on kill if the killer has the <a href = "Renown#Mysticism">Mysticism</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade, unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="m9">I</span>. Other pants are obtained in various ways, which are described in their corresponding pages.</p>
  <p>While unenchanted, standard Fresh Pants are as strong as iron pants. They can be enchanted in the <a href = "Mystic_Well">Mystic Well</a> with tier IX of Mysticism. Enchanting standard pants to tier I costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>1,000g</span></a>, upgrading them to tier II costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>4,000g</span></a>, and upgrading them to tier III costs <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>8,000g</span></a> and a sacrifice of the same color of pants.</p>
  <p>Enchanting Fresh Pants gives them a random number of lives that increases on every tier and removes their Kept on Death status. Lives decrease by 1 on death, or by 3 if their user logs out while in combat. Depleting all lives on a mystic item "breaks" it, destroying it forever.</p>
  <p>When enchanted, standard Fresh Pants gain random enchantments with varying effects. Upon upgrading to tier I, they gain 1–2 "<a href="Mystic_Well#Tokens">tokens</a>" – total tiers – of low-grade enchantments. When upgrading to tier II, they gain 1–2 more tokens of any enchantment (at most one of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>), and at tier III, they gain 1–4 more tokens (at most three of which can be <span class = md>RARE!</span>) – up to 8 total.</p>
  <p>Mystic Pants may not have more than 3 unique enchants or more than 8 tokens of enchantment, even through usage of the <a href = "Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a>.</p>
  <p>The list of enchantments that can be obtained at tier I or higher is as follows:</p>
