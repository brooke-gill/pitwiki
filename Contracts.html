<p><strong>Contracts</strong> are special tasks offered by the <a href = "NPCs">Quest Master</a>. Players can pay an initial fee, then complete the task provided to receive a higher amount of <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>gold</span></a>. If the player is doing a Big Time contract with the <a href = "Renown#Heresy">Heresy</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade, they have a chance to earn <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a>.</p>
<p>There are two types of contracts: Novice and Big Time. Novice contracts have a low cost and are easier but have low returns, whereas Big Time contracts cost more, are typically more difficult, and have higher returns. The price of contracts can be reduced by the <a href = "Renown#Scam_Artist">Scam Artist</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Upon purchasing a contract, players are given three options of tasks to choose from. Upon selecting the task, they will have five minutes to complete it. If the timer expires, the contract will end and the player will not receive rewards. Players may only complete 3 contracts per day, but this can be increased up to 8 by purchasing tiers of the <a href = "Renown#Contractor">Contractor</a> <a href="Renown"><span class="me">renown</span></a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Novice contracts cost <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>250g</span></a> and require level <span class = m2>30</span>. Completing them typically rewards <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>400 &ndash; 800 gold</span></a>.</p>
<p>A list of Novice contracts can be found below:</p>

  <p>Rarely, a contract can have a drastically increased requirement but a higher gold reward (up to <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>1,000g</span></a> for Novice Contracts and <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>5,000g</span></a> for Big Time Contracts).</p><br>
<p class = "section">Trivia</p>
<p>The <a href = "Renown#Do_Your_Own_Carpentry">Do Your Own Carpentry</a> upgrade increases the chance that Big Time contracts have Chunks of Vile as a reward and guarantees 2 chunks from contracts that have it as a reward.</p>
