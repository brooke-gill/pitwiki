<hr>
<p><strong>The Pit 1.0.6</strong> is the latest patch of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced the <a href="Perks#Bonk">Bonk!</a> perk, new ways to obtain <a href="Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a>, balance changes, bug fixes, and other minor changes.</p>

<p>The <a href = "The_Pit_1.0.5">Insurance</a> perk's name was changed to Bonk!. Instead of reviving the user, it now protects the user from the first hit from all players and gives them Resistance I (0:02) when blocking hits.</p>

<p>Some methods of obtaining <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile were buffed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href = "Renown">Do your Own Carpentry</a> <span class = me>renown</span> upgrade has been added to the Renown Shop. It increases the chance for Chunks of Vile to appear as rewards in <a href = "Contracts">contracts</a>, and increases the vile reward to 2 for contracts that have them.</li>
  <li>The <a href = "Killstreaks#Apostle_to_RNGesus">Apostle to RNGesus</a> killstreak's vile reward has been increased from 1 to 3. In game references to the reward still denote the reward as 1 vile.</li>
  <li><a href = "Auction">Auctions</a> can now have 3-6 Chunks of Vile as rewards.</li>
</ul>    

<p>Balance changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(<span class = ma>↑</span>) The <a href = "Renown#Yummy">Yummy</span> <span class = me>renown</span> upgrade now gives <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>+6g</span></a> instead of <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>+3g</span></a> when consuming golden apples and <a href = "Perks#Golden_Heads">Golden Heads</a>.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) The <a href = "Rage_Pants#Regularity">Regularity</a> mystic now reduces the damage of the second strike after additive bonuses are applied, rather than before.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) The <a href = "Sewer_Pants#Trash_Panda">Trash Panda</a> mystic now cannot be used while the <a href = "Magnum_Opus">Magnum Opus</a> megastreak is equipped.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Hermit">Bedrock</a> can no longer be stored in enderchests.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Mystic_Pants#Peroxide">Peroxide</a> cooldown increased from 1 second to 1.5 seconds.</li>
  <li>(<span class = mc>↓</span>) <a href = "Dark_Pants">Dark Pants</a> starting lives changed from a random multiple of 10 between 10 and 40 (inclusive) to a random multiple of 5 between 5 and 20 (inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed usage of the <a href = "Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a> not properly doubling the vile cost for <a href = "Magnum_Opus">Magnum Opus</a>.</li>
  <li><a href = "Item_Shop#Iron_Pack">Iron Pack</a> can no longer be purchased for <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>0g</span></a> when the player is already wearing all pieces of iron armor.</li>
  <li>Fixed the Big Time <a href = "Achievements">achievement</a> being unobtainable for players who did not purchase the Golden Pickaxe (Efficiency VII) when it was available in the <a href = "Renown">Renown Shop</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed <a href = "Killstreaks#Apostle_to_RNGesus"> giving <a href = "Gold"><span class = m6>gold</span></a> when it was intended to give <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>XP</span></a>.</li>
  <li><a href = "Item_Shop#FirstAid_Egg">First-Aid Egg</a> cooldown now resets on death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some exploits were also fixed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A time check (estimated to be about 9 minutes) has been added to earning participation <a href = "XP"><span class = mb>XP</span></a> in order to prevent players from earning it more often than intended.</li>
  <li>A distance limit (estimated to be about 4 blocks) has been added to the <a href = "Ender_Chest">Ender Chest</a> and <a href = "NPCs">NPCs</a>, preventing players from using blacklisted modifications to access them remotely.</li>
  <li>Players' streak is now reset when changing <a href = "Perks">perks</a>, preventing players from changing perks mid-streak following <a href = "Major_Event">major events</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two changes were additionally made to the <a href = "Pit_Supporter">Pit Supporter</a> package:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Now obtainable at <a href = "Prestige">prestige</a> <span class = m9>I</span> instead of <span class = m9>II</span>.</li>
  <li>Can now add enchantment glint to the <a href = "Renown#Fancy_Hat">Fancy Hat</a>. Glint has no gameplay effect.</li>
</ul>
