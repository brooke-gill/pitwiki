<hr>
<p><strong>The Pit 1.0.0</strong> marked the official release of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced <a href = "Killstreaks">Killstreaks</a>, new <a href = "Renown">renown</a> unlocks including <a href = "Item_Shop">shop items</a> and killstreak bundles in addition to the standard passive upgrades, <a href = "Achievements">achievements</a>, the profile viewer, <a href = "Pit_Supporter">Pit Supporter</a>, and many balance changes and bug fixes. The Renown Shop was divided into categories due to all of the upgrades added during the update.</p>

<p>The primary addition of the update, <a href = "Killstreaks">killstreaks</a>, allowed players to gain rewards or combat advantages by killing several players in a row without dying. In order to prevent players from becoming unkillable and reaching incredibly high killstreaks, <a href = "Megastreaks">megastreaks</a> were also added, which provide short-term benefits and a bonus upon death, but cause the user some detriment as their killstreak increases. Players have the <a href = "Overdrive">Overdrive</a> megastreak equipped by default and cannot un-equip it. Several items were added along with megastreaks, such as the <a href = "Beastmode">Beastmode Helmet</a> and <a href = "Totally_Legit_Gem">Totally Legit Gem</a>. A list of megastreaks may be found on the megastreaks page, and information on related items may be found on their respective megastreaks' pages.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Item_Shop">Item Shop</a> was also updated with ten new items available to unlock in the <a href = "Renown">Renown Shop</a>. A list of these items may be found on the Item Shop page.</p>

<p>In addition to the new killstreak bundles and shop items, the <a href = "Renown#Autobuy">Autobuy</a>, <a href = "Renown#Very_Yummy">Very Yummy</a>, <a href = "Renown#Experienceindustrial_Complex">Experience-Industrial Complex</a>, <a href = "One_Upper">One Upper</a>, <a href = "Renown#SelfConfidence">Self Confidence</a>, <a href = "Renown#Promotion">Promotion!!</a>, and <a href = "Renown#Celebrity">Celebrity</a> upgrades and the <a href = "Perks#Assistant_to_the_Streaker">Assistant to the Streaker</a>, <a href = "Renown#Coop_Cat">Co-op Cat</a>, and <a href = "Perks#Thick">Thick</a> perk were added to the Renown Shop.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Commands#view">/view [<span class = m7>username</span>]</span></a> command (and its shortcut, sneak + right-clicking on the target player) was introduced, allowing players to view the inventory and profile of the selected player.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Pit_Supporter">Pit Supporter</a> upgrade was also added and was available for purchase by players at Prestige <span class = m9>II</span> or higher. For 1,000 Hypixel Gold (The equivalent of $10 USD), players could purchase the ability to dye standard colors of <a href = "Mystic_Pants">Fresh Pants</a> and the <a href = "Commands#events">/events</a> command. Players who purchased Pit Supporter would have a star (✬) suffix next to their username in their nametag and in their chat messages.</p>
