<hr>
<p><strong>The Pit 0.4.1</strong> was the ninth major version of the Hypixel Pit. It introduced the <a href = "Castle">Castle</a> map and its related activities, the <a href = "Renown#Heresy">Heresy</a> renown upgrade and the day-night cycle, <a href = "Dark_Pants">Dark Pants</a>, and various balance changes, along with the <a href = "Renown#Raw_Numbers">Raw Numbers</a> renown upgrade.</p>

<p>The <a href = "Castle">Castle Map</a> was one of the major introductions in the update, boasting a large number of non-combat activities for players to partake in, most notably activities associated with the <a href = "Kings_Quest">King's Quest</a> and the <a href = "Sewers">Sewers</a> area. A list of these activities and the rewards for participating in them can be found on their respective pages.</p>

<p>The update also introduced the <a href = "Renown#Heresy">Heresy</a> renown upgrade, allowing players to complete <a href = "Night_Quests">Night Quests</a> at nightfall to receive <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a>, which could be used to craft <a href = "Dark_Pants">Dark Pants</a> at night. Crafting Dark Pants cost <a href = "Renown"><span class = me>2 renown</span></a> and 4–2 Chunk of Vile depending on the user's Heresy level. Notably, all Tier I enchanted Dark Pants were enchanted with Somber, which nullified the effects of <a href = "Mystic_Well">mystic enchantments</a> used on the user, but also prevented the user from using non-dark enchantments. All Dark enchantments obtained at Tier II came with a powerful effect but some drawback. At the time, Dark Pants were as strong as chainmail leggings, and were typically enchanted with "way higher lives" (usually 10-40 at Tier I, and 30–75 at Tier II). A list of Dark enchantments can be found on the <a href = "Dark_Pants">Dark Pants</a> page.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href = "Renown#Raw_Numbers">Raw Numbers</a> renown upgrade was added in this update. It allowed players to view the exact damage they'd dealt to a target in the action bar (in terms of health, not hearts). It could be purchased at Prestige <span class = m6>XIII</span> for <a href = "Renown"><span class = me>40 renown</span></a>.</p>

<p>The trading limit was also increased from (8 → 12) daily trades and <a href="Gold"><span class="m6">(30,000 → 50,000) gold</span></a>.
